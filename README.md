# API-Rate-Limit-testing-tool.

the reason for making this tool is when I face a proxy in front of the application. it is hard to use the burp suite intruder.

this tool is used for testing the API Rate limit vulnerability. there are some changes you have to change when using these tools like:

1. URL (you put your specific API)
2. if needs proxy. then change it to your proxy. for example, Burpsuite to track the requests and responses.
3. change the data response. depending on what data you get or what you want specifically.

In the end, I put the time and counted every request
